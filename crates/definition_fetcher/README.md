# wise_units-definition_fetcher

Internal tool for pulling down [ucum-essence.xml](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum-essence.xml)
and parsing it to TOML.

## Usage

From this directory, simply run:

```
$ cargo run
```

Then, since I haven't yet figured out how to transform some XML to Rust, you'll
have to manually do so.
