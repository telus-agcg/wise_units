# wise_units

![Build Status](http://teamcity-build.agrian.com/app/rest/builds/buildType%3Aid%3ACrates_WiseUnits_Test/statusIcon?guest=1)

A Rust library for measuring things in [UCUM](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html)
terms. It's similar to Ruby's [unitwise](https://github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise).

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.64
  - Get it [here](https://rustup.rs/)

## Usage

### Feature `serde`

wise_units provides the ability to (de)serialize `Measurement`s and its children
using the `serde` feature (using [serde](https://serde.rs)). This lets you
convert wise_units objects into (and from!) any of the many formats supported by
serde. For example, deserializing a `Measurement` looks like:

```rust
let m = Measurement::new(123.4, "m2").unwrap();
let json = serde_json::to_string(&m).unwrap();
let expected_json = r#"{"value":123.4,"unit":"m2"}";

assert_eq!(json, expected_json);
```

This feature is disabled by default. To enable it:

```toml
[dependencies]
wise_units = { version = "0.22", features = ["serde"] }
```

### Feature `v2`

The `v2` feature makes some new traits available--traits that are "fixed" versions of existing
traits. Putting these behind this feature flag allows us to try out these new traits in downstream
crates before switching them to be the main traits in `wise_units`.

## Examples

A `Measurement` is made up of some quantifier, the `value`, and the unit of measure,
the `unit`. Because the UCUM allows for combining its terms in almost infinite
combinations, it's most ergonomic to create a new `Measurement` (or more
specifically, its `Unit`) by letting the constructor accept a `str` slice that
gets parsed accordingly.

```rust
let subject = Measurement::new(5.0, "[pi].m2")
    .expect("These are valid UCUM terms so this shouldn't fail");

let converted = subject.convert_to("m2").unwrap();

assert_floats_eq(converted.value, 15.707_963_267);
```

Many more examples in [tests/measurements_test.rs](tests/measurements_test.rs).

## Development

### Running tests

To run the whole suite... Because of optional features in wise_units, to run all
tests, you should use the `--all-features` flag: `cargo test --all-features`.

### Static Analysis

Please run [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy):
`cargo clippy`.

Please also keep things tidy with
[rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt):
`cargo fmt`

### Generating Things

A bunch of code is generated from `Atoms.toml` using the `atom_generator`
executable. This needs to be run each time `Atoms.toml` gets updated (which is
hardly ever).
